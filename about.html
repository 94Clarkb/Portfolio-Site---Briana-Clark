                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Briana Clark. Due to the various pronunciations of my name, I also go by Bri (pronounced like "Brie" cheese, without the 'e') for ease of communication.</p>
                    <p>I am a UI/UX Designer and Developer with a diverse background spanning Psychology, Healthcare, Education, and Retail. Each of these fields has contributed invaluable experience to my skill set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began my academic journey with an Associate’s degree in Psychology, initially aspiring to become a psychiatrist. To gain hands-on experience with early childhood development, I taught in a Montessori setting, where I observed the alignment between children’s growth and my academic studies. Seeking to advance my career, I transitioned into the medical field, working as a Licensed Pharmacy Technician in both Retail and Hospital Inpatient Pharmacy. This experience broadened my perspective but ultimately led me to reassess my career goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I soon found myself exploring Pharmacy programs with the intent of becoming a pharmacist. Meanwhile, my husband, a software engineer, introduced me to the world of coding. His focus was on backend development, but he encouraged me to explore frontend development, which aligned more closely with my creative interests. This discovery ignited my passion for UI/UX Design and Development, leading to a significant career shift away from healthcare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creativity has always been a driving force in my life, evolving from a childhood escape into a lifelong passion. After working in roles focused on memorization and rapid decision-making, I yearned for the creative challenges that design and development offers. I find great satisfaction in navigating design puzzles and experiencing the “lightbulb” moments that spark a new idea or project. While I enjoy working on my own creative tasks, and can work well independently, I also thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others on different decisions relating to our projects. Feedback is debatably one of the most valuable things when designing solutions for others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UI/UX design enables me to serve others while pursuing my passion for creativity. My aspiration is to develop solutions that foster comfort, inspiration, and a sense of “coziness” in daily life, as I believe that life should not be overwhelmingly stressful all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my Psychology degree, I have completed the CareerFoundry UI Design Certification course, equipping me with the knowledge necessary to excel in this dynamic industry.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Now onto some fun questions!</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Where are you based?</h4><p>I was born and raised, and still currently reside in Virginia, United States. I call myself a hermit because I’ve hardly been out of the state, but have managed to move 12 times within it. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How do you spend your free time?</h4><p>Outside of time spent with my toddler and husband, I enjoy some solitude time filled with crafty things. I enjoy crochet, drawing, writing stories, cross stitching and embroidery. I love using my hands, and they get kind of cramped if I’m not using them in some way. I’d love to get back into music someday soon, when my toddler doesn’t want to steal everything I hold. I also enjoy taking nature walks and playing the occasional video game. Cozy ones, of course.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>What’s a fun fact about you?</h4><p>I’m not sure if it’s “fun”, but I completed my first novel at the age of 13, and am continuing to expand upon it today, nearly 17 years later! It is truly a labor of love. Fun fact about my fun fact is that I am now taking the novel and making it into a webtoon, as I think it fits in that medium better.</p>
                        </li>
