        <h1>Hakunetsu Studios - Responsive Web-App</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This web-app is designed to be a merchandise e-commerce shop for those looking for things relating to Hakunetsu Studios’s universe of books, webtoons, anime, video games and merchandise.  Anyone and everyone can find something that fits their taste.</p>

        <!--About the Project-->
        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>Help everyone find products quickly and easily to match their particular needs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>UX/UI Designer responsible for bringing this project from conception to delivery.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Project Duration</h2>
        <p>September 2024 - October 2024</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Responsibilities and Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5Ws</li>
            <li>User Flow Diagram</li>
            <li>Wireframes</li>
            <li>User Testing Notes and Results</li>
            <li>Desktop Design</li>
            <li>Mockups</li>
        </ul>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--5Ws-->
        <h2>5Ws</h2>
        <picture>
            <source srcset="" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="" alt="Image of 5Ws"> 
        </picture>
        <br>
        <p>The project brief provided me with the 5ws already established. I wanted to include it in the process now because it is a guiding light through the rest of the project. Remembering the 5ws through the entirety of the project ensures that I can remain focused on the direction the web-app will take.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--User Stories-->
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>“As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.”</li>
            <li>“As a customer, I want there to be a variety of payment options, so that I can choose the payment method that suits me best.”</li>
            <li>“As a returning customer, I want to be able to save items that I cannot buy to a wish list, so that I can purchase them at a later date.”</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Empathy is a driving force in UI and UX. It is an important thing to have and when I read these statements provided by the brief, I knew choosing only three would be challenging. I resonated with all of them, but these three stood out to me. I felt like these were common problems people have everyday with shopping online, but I personally felt these on a more personal level and could relate to the users when they shared their needs.</p>

        <!--MVP Objective-->
        <h2>MVP Objective</h2>
        <p>This web-app is designed to be a merchandise e-commerce shop for those looking for things relating to Hakunetsu Studios’s universe of books, webtoons, anime, video games and merchandise.  Anyone and everyone can find something that fits their taste.</p>
        <p>The MVP Objective was something I came up with next. After choosing the user stories and revisiting the 5Ws, I made the objective for the web-app. This is what the web-app is, and who it’s for. Its purpose.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--Low Fidelity Wireframes-->
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>The next thing I did was ideate by creating Low Fidelity wireframes. It is usually seen that user flows come before the wireframes, but I found that it was difficult for my ideas to come through unless I were to draw them out. This became part of my process, and is something unique to me and my workflow. After ideating and seeing everything put down onto canvas, I was then able to create the user flow more efficiently.</p>

     </div>
     <div>
        <!--User Flow-->
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <picture>
            <source srcset="" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="" alt="Image of Userflow">
        </picture>
        <br>
        <p>After the Low-Fidelity wireframes, I was able to come to the User Flow with a clear head. This ensured that the User Flow captured the exact direction I wanted the web-app to take, with plenty of room to adjust as needed later on. It was a challenge for me to do this process prior to the ideation phase with Low-Fidelity wireframes because I wasn’t able to think without seeing visually what the site would look like should it be built up. Only then could I see it take form and give me a better opportunity to design with a clear head.</p>
