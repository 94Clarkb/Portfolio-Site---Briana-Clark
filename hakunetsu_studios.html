        <h1>Hakunetsu Studios - Responsive Web-App</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This web-app is designed to be a merchandise e-commerce shop for those looking for things relating to Hakunetsu Studios’s universe of books, webtoons, anime, video games and merchandise.  Anyone and everyone can find something that fits their taste.</p>

     <div>
        <!--About the Project-->
        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>Help everyone find products quickly and easily to match their particular needs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>UX/UI Designer responsible for bringing this project from conception to delivery.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Project Duration</h2>
        <p>September 2024 - October 2024</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Responsibilities and Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5Ws</li>
            <li>User Flow Diagram</li>
            <li>Wireframes</li>
            <li>User Testing Notes and Results</li>
            <li>Desktop Design</li>
            <li>Mockups</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
     </div>
     <!--Possibly add a section here about "my Process" and have a ol about each step I took, and make each step a __blank link to that section in the project page-->
     <div>
        <!--5Ws-->
        <h2>5Ws</h2>
        <img src="Img/Hakunetsu Studios/5Ws Img x1.png" alt="Image of 5Ws">
        <br>
        <p>The project brief provided me with the 5ws already established. I wanted to include it in the process now because it is a guiding light through the rest of the project. Remembering the 5ws through the entirety of the project ensures that I can remain focused on the direction the web-app will take.</p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--User Stories-->
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>“As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.”</li>
            <li>“As a customer, I want there to be a variety of payment options, so that I can choose the payment method that suits me best.”</li>
            <li>“As a returning customer, I want to be able to save items that I cannot buy to a wish list, so that I can purchase them at a later date.”</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Empathy is a driving force in UI and UX. It is an important thing to have and when I read these statements provided by the brief, I knew choosing only three would be challenging. I resonated with all of them, but these three stood out to me. I felt like these were common problems people have everyday with shopping online, but I personally felt these on a more personal level and could relate to the users when they shared their needs.</p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--MVP Objective-->
        <h2>MVP Objective</h2>
        <p>This web-app is designed to be a merchandise e-commerce shop for those looking for things relating to Hakunetsu Studios’s universe of books, webtoons, anime, video games and merchandise.  Anyone and everyone can find something that fits their taste.</p>
        <p>The MVP Objective was something I came up with next. After choosing the user stories and revisiting the 5Ws, I made the objective for the web-app. This is what the web-app is, and who it’s for. Its purpose.</p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--Low Fidelity Wireframes-->
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>The next thing I did was ideate by creating Low Fidelity wireframes. It is usually seen that user flows come before the wireframes, but I found that it was difficult for my ideas to come through unless I were to draw them out. This became part of my process, and is something unique to me and my workflow. After ideating and seeing everything put down onto canvas, I was then able to create the user flow more efficiently.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="Img/Hakunetsu Studios/Low-Fidelity Wireframes Imgx1.png" alt="Image of Low-Fidelity Wireframes">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--User Flow-->
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <img src="Img/Hakunetsu Studios/UserFlow_Imgx1.png" alt="Image of Userflow">
        <br>
        <p>After the Low-Fidelity wireframes, I was able to come to the User Flow with a clear head. This ensured that the User Flow captured the exact direction I wanted the web-app to take, with plenty of room to adjust as needed later on. It was a challenge for me to do this process prior to the ideation phase with Low-Fidelity wireframes because I wasn’t able to think without seeing visually what the site would look like should it be built up. Only then could I see it take form and give me a better opportunity to design with a clear head.</p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--Mid-Fidelity Wireframes-->
        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Once the User Flows were completed, I was able to come back to the wireframes and add some more structure, preparing the Mid-Fidelity Wireframes for a Prototype test for users.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="Img/Hakunetsu Studios/Mid-Fidelity Wireframes Imgx1.png" alt="Image of Mid-Fidelity Wireframes">
        <br>
        <p>Seeing the web-app come together was something exciting to me and kept me motivated throughout. I’ve heard including Mid-Fidelity wireframes into Case Studies can confuse those who look at it, but I wanted to include them here because I feel the whole process is something that keeps me going. Seeing where it came from and seeing it grow throughout all stages is amazing to me. I always remind myself that it’s more about the journey, rather than only thinking of the outcome. Cherishing the process makes the result even more gratifying.</p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--Prototyping-->
        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <p>I chose some users at this point to test two prototypes I made, one of a Mobile Breakpoint and one of the Desktop Breakpoint. I gave them the same tasks to complete for both breakpoints and asked them to give me feedback based on their experience.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="Img/Hakunetsu Studios/Prototyping Feedback Imgx1.png" alt="Image of Prototype Results">
        <br>
        <p>The feedback was good, although I feel it could have been more substantial had I recruited more people to look at my prototypes and test them. I was able to take the feedback I got, however, and was able to think of good solutions moving forward. Any feedback was good feedback to me.</p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div>
        <!--Design System-->
        <h2>Design System</h2>
        <p>After the feedback from Prototype Testing, it was time to create the Design System that would be implemented moving forward into the final stages of design of the Web-App. I first started with Typography, then the Color Palette and ended with the Button Styles, Icons and Logo Design.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <br>
                <img src="Img/Hakunetsu Studios/Typography Imgx1.png" alt="Image of Typography">
                <br>
                <p>Comfortaa was chosen because of its soft and round nature. The essence of this brand is soft and light, so it was only fitting to bring that into the typography as well. The round edges evoke the feeling of comfort, and yet it still manages to feel fun too.</p>
                <p>I also went for the Comfortaa font family because the round edges compliment the roundness of the logo; keeping the branding consistent throughout.</p>
                <p>Abril Fatface was chosen to contrast against the roundness of Comfortaa to draw attention to the new collections and other important areas of the site.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Color Palette</h3>
                <br>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="" alt="Image of Color Palette">
                </picture>
                <br>
                <p>These colors were chosen as a way to capture the minimalistic nature of Asian culture. Red is the only true color in the group, and is there to evoke the feeling of luck and prosperity that it traditionally carries in places like China and Japan.</p>
                <p>The black color is more of a deep blue, and feels softer. Traditionally a strong black would be seen against the red in the culture, but I wanted to veer a little from what is done usually. It is softer on the eyes and is more comforting to look at.</p>
                <p>White and off white are used around the space of the web app, making sure that when there are colors, they will pop off the page.</p>
                <p>The brown that’s used for these pages will be used as small backgrounds only. It’s a neutral tone, and feels warm to look at.</p>
                <p>I went with a minimal color palette because I want the products to be the sources of color. The space around the products will be white and minimal. The products will stand out in this manner, and users will know for certain what they are supposed to be looking at.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Logo & UI Elements</h3>
                <br>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="" alt="Image of Logo & UI Elements">
                </picture>
                <br>
                <p>The logo features a Japanese lantern, harboring a soft yet warm glow. It has a comforting look to it. It also has a little Japanese wind chime, known as “fūrin” at the bottom of the lantern. These two things capture the essence of Japanese culture, and offer light to guide the path forward. The lantern also has a drop shadow effect to give the look of paper, which feels a little reminiscent of Origami. This effect returns some texture back to the paper lantern that can get lost within digital art.</p>
                <p>On the right is the name of the studio, Hakunetsu.  The name is displayed vertically, in the way you’d find Japanese characters written out in books.</p>

        <!--High-Fidelity Wireframes-->
        <h2>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After the stage of picking my Design System, I was able to go and design the final screens for the Web App. This was a fun stage because I got to see everything finally come together into a site I was proud of.</p>

        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeling like experience is paying off. Looking at this project against the rest of my projects makes me feel like I have greatly evolved my UI/UX skills.</li>
                    <li>The color palette was something done on a whim and it ended up looking very good.</li>
                    <li>Working on this app as a web-app challenged me to develop my skills further.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What Didn't Go Well?</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user-flow process was very counterintuitive for how I process creative decisions, and it felt quite difficult while making it. I found that I spent too much time getting caught up on it, and pressed forward without completing it. I came back to it at the end, which defeated the purpose of making it in the first place.</li>
                    <li>Not testing more frequently throughout the iteration process.</li>
                    <li>Being that this was a personal project, it was challenging to keep my “wants” at bay.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How To Improve?</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice more with user-flows, trying to simplify as much as possible. They don’t need to be extravagant. The world of UI/UX uses them, and therefore I should too. I need to find a way to make user flows that aligns with how I creatively process ideas.</li>
                    <li>Make sure I am testing in some capacity during multiple iterations of the app. Test as if I’m testing for stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>When testing, make sure the user’s needs are being met before personal features are added in. Remember that my “wants” may actually be something the user doesn’t want.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
